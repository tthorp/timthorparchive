<h2>1979 Honda Civic Hatchback</h2>
<p>Bought it when I was 14 years old for $100. It had been totalled in an accident, but I pried the fender off the back tire with a cro-bar and replaced the rear light that was broken. Stick shift with an 1,169 cc engine. I once drove it 110 miles per hour on the rte. 4 hill that runs through East Greenwich between the milk farm and the high school. Also, took it for "air" several times on upper Middle Road. Kept it until I was 17.</p>

<h2>1984 Audi 4000s</h2>
<p>Nice car for a teenager who bought with his own hard-earned money @ $3.25/hr. Stick shift, really expensive to run due to fuel injection issues...had it serviced by Hans Imports in North Kingstown. Kept this until I was 19.</p>

<h2>Honda Spree</h2>
<p>I got this for around $100. Fun to ride around on but probably looked silly. When it was about to run out of gas, it would speed up to ~40mph. Worked great until I tried to jump-start it but reversed the polarity and fried the electric system.</p>

<h2>1979 Fiat Spyder</h2>
<p>I managed to own or borrow this for a summer. Fun to have a convertible except for that one time when I floored it to ascend a hill on rte 1 and the gas pedal got stuck. It was a hairy situation as I approached a construction site at 80mph and couldn't unstick the gas. Eventually, I shut off the ignition, but not early enough to escape the police officer that was pretty upset with my driving.</p>

<h2>1986 Chevy C-10</h2>
<p>Got this truck from a vehicle auction. It had been in a rollover. It had a lift kit on the body that was actually just 2 hockey pucks in-between the body and the frame. Rebuilt it, put in a bunch of aftermarket engine parts like a holley carburetor and edelbrock intake manifolds and headers with straight exhaust pipes. </p>

<h2>1978 Dodge Truck</h2>
<p>My dad bought this, but I have happy memories in it. </p>

<h2>1978 Dodge Sportvan (Sweet Pickles)</h2>
<p>A monster van with an extended cab. Fun to drive. Huge V-8 engine, passed everything except the gas station. Lost interest when a brake job cost thousands.</p>

<h2>1981 Yamaha Midnight Special</h2>
<p>Very powerful 1100cc engine. Fun to ride until I hit a Cadillac (his fault, not mine) and went over and through the handlebars. Badly broken leg, otherwise fine.</p>

<h2>1984 Toyota Celica</h2>
<p>Stick shift. Strong 4 cylinder engine, rear-wheel drive. Fun ride. Was $400 and had been rear-ended. I pulled the dent, filled the repair site with bondo and spray painted with silver Krylon paint. I sold it to Rone and it was stolen and used in a series of robberies. The police questioned me and Rone about them.</p>

<h2>Stanza</h2>
<p>What a piece of junk. I was driving it on the highway and the sunroof actually flew off. Worked fine, but then I got rear-ended in a hit and run accident. There was no question that the car was totalled.</p>

<h2>Maxima</h2>
<p>Nice car, but this was my last "old and cheap" car. I remember paying over $600/month in repairs and a commercial came on TV for a sweet Jeep Cherokee, brand new that would lease for less money monthly. </p>

<h2>1996 Civic Hatchback</h2>
<p>I liked this car. Got it used in 1998. Sat low, stick shift. Basic but peppy. </p>

<h2>1998 Toyota 4Runner</h2>
<p>Really nice SUV. Fun to drive, nice to look at. Never went off-roading with it.</p>

<h2>Ford F250</h2>
<p>Not enough cargo for a family trip, not enough truck for serious work, but a lot of power in the engine. Fix Or Repair Daily.</p>

<h2>2009 Chevy Silverado</h2>
<p>First vehicle I ever bought brand new. Proud to have purchased with no options. Just a work truck with a vinyl floor. V-6 engine</p>

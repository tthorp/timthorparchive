<h1><?=TITLE?></h1>
<p>There are several problems with the existing bathroom:</p>
<ul>
	<li>there are stains on the fixtures</li>
	<li>the drains are old and cast iron (read: risk of breaking) and don't flow very well</li>
	<li>the colors are awful and the walls have been discolored by condensation drips</li>
	<li>there is mold around the tub, on the ceiling and apparently, under the floor</li>
	<li>the floor is vinyl and cracked</li>
	<li>there is a large steam radiator taking up a lot of space</li>
	<li>the tub is 28" deep and really cramped</li>
	<li>the shelves are made of oriented strand board and could be improved</li>
	<li>the shower doors do not slide without serious effort</li>
	<li>the water feeding the sink is piped with brass pipes and (probably) leaded solder</li>
	<li>the curtains are ugly</li>
	<li>even the soap/toothbrush holder thing is rusty</li>
</ul>
